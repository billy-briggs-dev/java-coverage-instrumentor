# Java Coverage Instrumentor - Project Summary

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Java Coverage Instrumentor project, a complete code coverage platform designed for multi-language extensibility.

## 🎯 Project Overview

The Java Coverage Instrumentor is a sophisticated code coverage platform that implements real-time bytecode instrumentation using ByteBuddy and streams coverage data via gRPC. It serves as the foundation for a multi-language coverage platform that can be extended to support Node.js, Python, Go, and other languages.

## 🏗️ Architecture Components

### 1. Coverage Common (`coverage-common/`)
**Purpose**: Shared interfaces, data models, and protocol definitions

**Key Files**:
- `coverage.proto` - Protocol Buffers schema defining gRPC services and data structures
- `CoverageConfig.java` - YAML-based configuration management
- `ExecutionPoint.java` - Coverage data model representing code execution points
- `CoverageType.java` - Enumeration of coverage types (LINE, BRANCH, METHOD, etc.)

**Technologies**: Protocol Buffers 3.24.3, Jackson YAML, Java 17

### 2. Coverage Agent (`coverage-agent/`)
**Purpose**: Java bytecode instrumentation agent using ByteBuddy

**Key Files**:
- `CoverageAgent.java` - Main agent entry point with premain method
- `CoverageTransformer.java` - ByteBuddy-based class transformation
- `CoverageReporter.java` - gRPC client for streaming coverage data

**Technologies**: ByteBuddy 1.14.5, gRPC 1.58.0, Java Instrumentation API

**Features**:
- Real-time bytecode instrumentation
- Configurable coverage granularity
- Asynchronous gRPC streaming
- Low-overhead execution tracking

### 3. Coverage Collector (`coverage-collector/`)
**Purpose**: Central gRPC service for aggregating coverage data

**Key Files**:
- `CoverageCollector.java` - Main server application
- `CoverageServiceImpl.java` - gRPC service implementation
- `CoverageDataStore.java` - In-memory coverage data aggregation

**Technologies**: gRPC Server, Jackson YAML, concurrent data structures

**Features**:
- High-throughput gRPC streaming
- Real-time data aggregation
- Health monitoring endpoints
- Extensible storage backends

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### ByteBuddy Instrumentation Strategy
```java
// Example transformation targeting method entries
AgentBuilder.Transformer transformer = (builder, typeDescription, classLoader, module) ->
    builder.visit(Advice.to(MethodEntryAdvice.class).on(ElementMatchers.isMethod()));
```

### gRPC Protocol Definition
```protobuf
service CoverageService {
  rpc StreamCoverage(stream CoverageEvent) returns (CoverageResponse);
  rpc GetAggregatedCoverage(CoverageRequest) returns (CoverageSummary);
}
```

### Configuration Management
- YAML-based configuration files
- Environment variable override support
- Runtime configuration updates
- Language-specific configuration sections

## 🚀 Multi-Language Extensibility

### Design Principles
1. **Protocol-First**: gRPC protocol serves as the universal interface
2. **Language-Agnostic Data Models**: Protocol Buffers ensure cross-language compatibility
3. **Modular Architecture**: Each language agent operates independently
4. **Unified Collection**: Single collector aggregates data from all agents

### Extension Points
```yaml
# Future language support structure
languages:
  java:
    agent: "coverage-agent-java.jar"
    runtime: "jvm"
  nodejs:
    agent: "coverage-agent-node.js"
    runtime: "node"
  python:
    agent: "coverage-agent-python.py"
    runtime: "python"
```
